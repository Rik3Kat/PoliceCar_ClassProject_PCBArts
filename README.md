# PoliceCar_ClassProject_PCBArts

Here are the files for my project.
The PCB consists of a simple curcuit: 

one 9V battery that powers everything

eight resistors
                                     
two capacitors
                                      
two transistors
                                      
two LED in the colour red and blue which alternately blink
                                       
four white LED which light up constantly

one slider switch which turns the lights of the curcuit on and off

The board of the PCB is desinged in the shape of an old school police car. The curcuit and the the footprint part are fixed to the frontside of the board. 
The actual design of the PCB with the different layers is on the backside of the board. 
pppppp
